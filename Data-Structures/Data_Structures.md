# Data Structures

Data Structures are collection of values, the relationship among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data

## Why Data Structures ?

- Data structures allow us to organize our data, which enables efficient insertion, deletion and search operations.
- Different data structures are suited to different problems, so knowing a range of data structures can help you to solve a wider range of problems.
- They provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently. Efficient data structures are a key to designing efficient algorithms.
- Some data structures are used to make specific tasks more efficient, such as using a queue to manage processes in a task scheduler, or a hash map for efficient lookups.
- They are necessary for design of efficient algorithms. For example, an efficient sorting algorithm can be used to sort data stored in a certain data structure.

## Types of Data Structures

1. **Arrays**: A collection of elements identified by array index.
2. **Linked List**: Each element is a separate object that contains a reference (or link) to the next object in the list. [More on Linked List](/Data-Structures/Linked-List/Linked_List.md)
3. **Stack**: A LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure. [More on Stack](/Data-Structures/Stack/Stack.md)
4. **Queue**: A FIFO (First In First Out) data structure. [More on Queue](/Data-Structures/Queue/Queue.md)
5. **Tree**: A data structure where each element is attached to one (or more than one) other elements in a parent-child relationship. [More on Trees](/Data-Structures/Trees/Trees.md)
6. **Graph**: A collection of nodes or vertices, where each node or vertex is connected by a edge.
7. **Hashing**: A data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.
