# PROBLEM SOLVING APPROACH

1. Understand the Problem.
2. Explore the Concrete Examples.
3. Break it Down.
4. Solve/Simply.
5. Look Back and Refactor.

## Detailed Explanation of the approaches

### 1. Understand the Problem

- Can I restate the problem in my own words
- What are the inputs that go into the problem
- What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem
- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words do I have enough information to solve the problem
- How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem

### 2. Explore the Concrete Example

- Simple examples
- Complex examples
- Examples with empty input
- Examples with invalid

[Character Count. Example](/Problem%20Solving%20Approach/characterCount.js)

### 3. Break it Down

- Explicitly Write out the steps you need to take.

[Character Count. Example](/Problem%20Solving%20Approach/charCount.js)

### 4. Solve/Simplify

- Can you check the result
- Can you derive the result differently
- Can you understand it at a glance
- Can you use the result or method for some other problem
- Can you improve the performance of you solution
- Can you think of other ways to refactor
- How have other people solved this problem

### 4. Look Back and Refactor

- Try to analyze the code and refactor to make if possible to make it more efficient and readable and also up to the standards
