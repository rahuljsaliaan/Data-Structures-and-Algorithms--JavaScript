# Searching Algorithms

## Linear Search

- Given an array the simplest solution way to search for an value is to look at every single element in an array and check if it's the value we want
- It has a time complexity of O(n) (worst and average case)

Inbuilt methods that follow linear search

- IndexOf
- includes
- find
- findIndex

## Binary Search

- Binary search is much more faster form of search
- Rather than eliminating one element at a time, you can eliminate half of the remaining elements at a time
- Binary search only works on sorted array's !
- It is an example for Divide and Conquer Problem solving approach
- It has time complexity of O(log n) (worst and average case)
